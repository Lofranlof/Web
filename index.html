            <h3>My story about how I got into lifting</h3>
            <p>
            <p>Yeah, basically I was playing The Last of Us: Part 2 and one of the main characters, Abby, had
                <em>massive guns instead of human arms</em>,
            </p>
            <p>so I thought to myself: "I want to be as jacked and stacked as her". I went to my mom to ask her for a
                membership in the
                closest gym that was 20 minutes away on a bycicle.</p>

            <p>From that day, I've been going to the gym on a regular basis. That's how it all started. </p>

            <h3>How to supplement your training for optimal gains:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>SLEEP!</strong></p>
                    <p>Sleeping is crucial when it comes to recovering and gaining muscles, do not neglect it!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Eating</p>
                    <p>You have to eat enough, so that your body will have the material to recover you with.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Training</p>
                    <p>Training is when you tell your muscles it is time to grow, recovery is when they actually grow.
                        It's yin and yang of lifting.
                    <p>If you wanna grow muscles, you gotta pay attention to both.</p>
                    <p>You have to be consistent with your training and have at least some idea about what you are doing
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplements</p>
                    <p>You can take multivitamins and omega 3's, but they are not necessary, because can be derived from
                        nutrition</p>
                </li>
